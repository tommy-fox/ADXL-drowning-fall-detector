# wearable-ADXL345-Teensy3.2

 This program congifures an ADXL345 accelerometer and Teensy 3.2 controller to detect drowning as well as falling.
  
 Double Tap and Free Fall ADXL interrupts are utilized for this functionality.
 Tap settings are configured so that if device is worn around the wrist,
 drowning is detected by rapid hand motion, but not triggered by normal swimming.
  
 Double Tap also participates with the Free Fall interrupt in falling detection.
